# Learning Activities & Resources
This week I learnt a lot about the Joomla interface and how to edit sites using Joomla which is the Content Management System chosen for this week. I learnt through a mix of YouTube videos and LinkedIn Learning.

# Estimated Hours
I spent around 5 hours learning about Joomla and web hosting and spent about 2 hours building the site.

# Content Insights
Although there are a lot of features on Joomla's interface, it is an easy-to-use content management system once you know the basics. For example, to make a webpage, you need to create an article. When you publish an article, it shows up on the website etc. Overall, the content and the building of websites using Joomla was basic but I spent a lot of time learning the software and learning about the interface and function of the features on the website.

# Career/Employability/Learning Insights
From the courses on LinkedIn and the YouTube videos that I saw, I can now apply the necessary skills into the making of websites for almost any purpose. Since Joomla makes the building of websites much easier and code-free, the skill of making a website using Joomla can be directly applied for future purposes. Joomla makes it very easy to make websites without much effort.
